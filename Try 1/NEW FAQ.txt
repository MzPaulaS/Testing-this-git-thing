# FAQ

## I am having iCloud issues, like files not syncing.
Here are several steps to try and resolve the issue:

1) Sometimes your files appear to be stuck, i.e. the files won't up- or download changes. Please reboot the affected device. Usually document sync will pick back up. If not, please try the reboot again, before contacting us.

2) Make sure you are signed into the same iCloud account on all your devices.

3) Verify that "iCloud Drive" is enabled in the iCloud settings.

	macOS: System Preferences → iCloud → iCloud Drive

	iOS: Settings app → iCloud → iCloud Drive

4) Make sure: 

	* You are connected to a WiFi network and/or "Use Cellular Data", in the iCloud Drive settings, is enabled (this setting is iOS only)

	* MindNode is allowed to save in iCloud Drive. On iOS you see a list of apps in the iCloud Drive settings. You find this in the Settings app under iCloud → iCloud Drive. Right below is a list of allowed apps. On a Mac click Options next to iCloud Drive, in the iCloud settings in System Preferences. MindNode should be enabled on both devices.

	* Check your Setting for Optimize Storage in the System Preferences. If it is checked, your documents will only be stored locally if there is enough disk space.

5) Check the (iCloud System Status)[https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/] to learn of any iCloud service issues. Look for the iCloud Drive Status.

6) On iOS verify that MindNode uses iCloud:
Press the gear icon in the Document Picker. Go to Settings. Then enable `iCloud Drive`in the Sharing section.

7) Verify that the correct time is set on your device (incorrect time settings will cause iCloud to reject the connection).

8) Make sure that you are not behind a firewall that blocks incoming or outgoing iCloud traffic (also applies to utilities like Little Snitch, TCPBlock, etc…), or that you are not using a managed device (company owned) that disallows iCloud.

9) When files are not uploaded to iCloud, ensure that you have enough free space on iCloud. The free plan only comes with 5 GB of total iCloud storage.


## Do I have to purchase both MindNode for iOS and MindNode for Mac?
iOS and macOS are separate operating systems with their own corresponding App Stores. It is currently not possible to create a single app that works both platforms. This is why MindNode for iOS and MindNode for Mac are two separate apps that need to be purchased individually if you want to use MindNode on both platforms.

MindNode for iOS is an universal app. You can install it on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple Watch.

## How do I install MindNode on a second, or new device?

* To download MindNode for iOS again: (Apple’s instructions)[http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2519]

* To download MindNode for iOS again: (Apple’s instructions)[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4483]

Note: It is not possible to install MindNode for iOS on your Mac or MindNode for Mac on your iOS device.

You can install MindNode for Mac on up to five computers, and MindNode for iOS on up to 10 iOS devices associated with your Apple ID.


## I purchased MindNode Pro previously, how can I reinstall it?
MindNode 2 for Mac replaces MindNode Pro, so you will no longer see it as available on the App Store. If you purchased it from the Mac App Store you can re-download it from the “Purchased” tab from inside the App Store application on your Mac.
